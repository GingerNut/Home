        As we move into April we have a lot of interesting things lined up.
    </p>

    <p>
        Nature is pouring forth an abundance of new growth and here at
        growing games we have been working hard.
    </p>

    <p>
        We have a new teaser app for hnefatafl <a href="/hnefatafl/hnefatafl.html">

        here</a> on the site. The AI is not the best, but there are good
        reasons for this. Suffice to say you will be better off trying
        to find a human opponent. But if this little app stirs your
        interest it has been worth the time spent putting it together.
    </p>

    <p>
        It seems particulary appropriate to be thinking about what may
        be viking games while <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/news_and_press/press_releases/2013/vikings_life_and_legend.aspx">
        The Vikings Are Coming . . .</a> exhihibition is running at the
        British Museum. And by coincidence (or is it?),
        Joanne Harris is touring the country reading from
        <a href="http://www.joanne-harris.co.uk/v3site/books/loki/index.html">
            The Gospel Of Loki</a>, a book that I have read and very
        much enjoyed. Is Viking culture having a revival?
    </p>

    <p>
        On another subject, we are working toward launching swurdle as an android app in the
        next month of so. Swurdle is a word game based upon ideas of growing
        a line of words to battle it out on the board against your
        opponent's line of words. There are elements of go in this game,
        and it is complex - certainly not for those of your who like
        simple games that take seconds to learn. At growing games we think
        there is room for complex games as well as simple games.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will look forward to hearing your comments on it soon.
